# first_neural_network

We developed a simple neural network in Python using the libraries Theano, Tensorflow and Keras.

We follow the tutorial present here: 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/ 

This repository also contains the dataset used to try the neural network.
